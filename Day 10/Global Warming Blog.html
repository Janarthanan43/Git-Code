<p class="brown">Global warming is a significant environmental issue.
  “Global warming” refers to the rise in global temperatures due mainly to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 
  “Climate change” refers to the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time – including precipitation, 
  temperature, and wind patterns.</p>
<p class="blue">It poses a threat to our planet's climate and ecosystems.</p>
<p class="green">It is crucial to take action to reduce carbon emissions.
  Global warming can result in many serious alterations to the environment, eventually impacting human health. It can also cause a rise in sea level,
  leading to the loss of coastal land, a change in precipitation patterns, increased risks of droughts and floods, and threats to biodiversity.
